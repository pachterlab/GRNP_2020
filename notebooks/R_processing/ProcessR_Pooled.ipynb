        "This notebook assembles CU histograms from multiple datasets for use in pooled prediction, a method in which lowly expressed genes can get a more stable CU histogram by \"borrowing\" information from similar datasets. We create two variants here - pooled data from full datasets and pooled data from downsampled dataset (downsampled 10 times). The reason for the latter is for use with down-sampling experiments, such as figure 3. We generate pooled data from 6 PBMC 10X datasets. For the downsampled variant, we downsample each dataset 10 times and pool a total of 60 datasets, since so much information is lost in the downsampling.\n",
